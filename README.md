## My Project 
- Ai Model Training <br>
his project was about training an AI model to predict chronic kidney disease. My main role was a Tester. <br>
I tested if the model gave the correct results. I checked whether the prediction was right when putting in different patient values, and reported any wrong outputs so the team could fix and improve the model.
